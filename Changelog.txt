Version 0.1 (12-5-2010)

- Initial release

Version 0.1.1 (12-7-2010)

- Fix broken restore sequence (you now need to press (B) on the start screen, instead of (A))
- Fixes and improvements to the restore function (verifies that .sav size >= save chip size, and that a save chip is present at all)

Version 0.2 (12-30-2010)

- Add an ini file (using libini by Simon White); drop it in the same directory as the homebrew or in the root folder if it does not work
- Add Wifi backup/restore mode (using ftplib by Thomas Pfau)
- Add File browsing
- Add (very experimental) Slot-2 Flash Card detection routine. If this works as expected, I will add a full Slot-2 based backup mechanism later.
- (hopefully) fix some issues with the EZFlash 3in1

Version 0.2.1 (1-9-2011)

- Definitely fix issues with EZFlash 3in1 mode on the EZFlash Vi (and probably several other cards as well).

Version 0.2.2 (2-12-2011)

- Fix more glitches with older EZFlash 3in1s. Enable 1-pass restore process.
- Add safety mechanism for WiFi restore process; if the file transfer fails, nothing will be deleted.

Version 0.2.3 (3-4-2011)

- Fix a 3in1 backup bug introduced with 0.2.2, dumping works again.
- Improves stability of the WiFi backup/restore processes. The program will no longer freak out if something interferes with the transfer.
- Adds partial GBA backup/restore mode (EEPROM is not supported yet).

Version 0.2.4 (4-10-2011)

- Modify 3in1 backup path so that it supports 3in1 with dead battery.
- Make it clearer when FTP mode has hit a small delay and the program is trying to continue.
- Program now makes use of lower screen for most messages, which allows longer, more detailled messages.
- Adds a Readme file/Manual to the program.

Version 0.3.0 RC1 (8-??-2011)

This is the first non-beta, feature complete release.

- Adds the ability to translate most parts of the user interface.
- Adds Slot 2 backup mode (you will need a Slot 2 flash card; anything that has a DLDI driver should be supported).
- Enables FTP restore mode for saves bigger than the memory buffer (usually 2 MB).
- Various stability fixes.
- Many behind-the scenes improvements aimed to simplify further hacking.
- Instruction file is no longer beta.
